# data_structure-JAVA-
this is the repository to store the basic data structures using JAVA version.
Compared with JAVA, C++ is much closer to the bottom. So some of the implementations in C++ is much harder.
JAVA has muture classes and complete functions. So using JAVA to implemente data structures enables me to focus more on the logic and algorithm itself, not on the implementations of functionality.
